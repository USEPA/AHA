08/26/2013 (C. Hillock) this coal-fired boiler does not serve a generator having nameplate capacity greater than 25 MW, as a result the unit is exempt from the ARP (the associated generator has a 14.5 MW nameplate capacity).  There is a proposal to expand and modify the facility starting in 2013-14.  This would consist of addition of a new gas-fired combined-cycle unit and modification/conversion of the existing boiler to burn mostly biomass.

Robert Miller spoke with Lynn Wallace (225.766.7400) 11/9/09 at the Nachitoches facility in Louisiana (plant code 1450) regarding unit 10 and why it wasn't ""flagged"" in SMS for being subject to CAIR SO2 and CAIROS, even though it is subject to the ARP and is flagged for CAIRNOX.  This was an oversight on the part of the facility owners/operators, and Ms. Wallace assured me she will update the Cert of Rep within the week to reflect the fact that it is subject to CAIR SO2 and CAIROS .  She was also told that the facility must have enough ozone season allowances to account for unit 10's 2009 ozone season emissions by 11/30 2009.","LA    ","LA069",4911,6,,,,,31.7705,-93.0952,"bwimberl",2001-07-05 00:00:00,2009-11-12 10:06:35,"110003267241",173,,"EDR",

05/17/2011 (C. Hillock)  Babcock & Brown purchased this facility in 2007 and then went bankrupt in 2009.  The facility last operated in early 2009. The facility and property were sold in May 2011 to the Pampa Economic Development Corp.  Plans were to turn the property into an industrial park, and hopefully sell the inactive power plant to a new owner who will refurbish and restart it.
04/25/2007 - L DeSantis - per cover letter submitted with Cert of Rep - This facility is currently generating electricity and steam as an exempt ARP cogen plant.  The future plans for this power plant include replacement of the 29.955 MWe generator with a larger 161 MWe generator.  After installation and startup of the new generator, the facility will routinely sell more than one third of its' potential electrical output capacity to the electrical grid.  It is anticipated this will occur in the first quarter of 2009.  Contacts:  David Townsend (281-474-6513) or Forest Plunk (806-663-4425) or Paul Despres (512-374-2227).

7614,55866,"Basin Creek","11/01/2005 - L DeSantis - Per Robert Miller (CAMD), the 9 units are stand-alone Caterpillar internal combustion engines burning pipeline natural gas, each unit serves a 6.1 MW generator (approximately 55 MW total for the plant).  Since each of the units is new (i.e., producing electricity for sale after Nov 15 ,1990), small (each serves a total nameplate capacity less than 25 MW), and clean (burning fuel that has sulfur content by weight of less than .05% on an annual average basis), each of these 9 units meets the new unit exemption requirements under 40 CFR 72.7 and are not subject to the Acid Rain Program under 40 CFR 72.6.

7/25/2011 - L DeSantis - Units 6A, 6B, 7A and 7B are being moved from Wansley (oris 6052) to Wansley CC (oris 55965).  Robert Miller of CAMD has confirmed that this is a separate facility from Wansley (oris 6052) for the following reasons:

(1) Each group of units are operated by different operators.  Units 1, 2, and 5A are operated by Georgia Power, units 6A, 6B, 7A, and 7B are operated by Southern Power.  Electricity produced by all of the units is dispatched by a 3rd party.

(2) None of the seven units listed above are jointly owned by Georgia Power and Southern Power.  Units 1, 2, and 5A are owned by Georgia Power and other non-Southern entities units 6A, 6B, 7A, and 7B are wholly owned by Southern Power.

(3) Although located on one piece of contiguous property, each group of units are physically separate, and do not share any common stacks or other emissions measuring or reporting equipment, save for the ECMPS client tool software currently used to collate and submit the emissions data recorded by each group's respective monitoring equipment under 40 CFR part 75.  In addition, each group of units has its own dedicated transmission line to transfer the power produced by the units to the grid.

(4)  According to Mr. Cornwell at GA DNR, the request from GA Power and Southern Power to GA DNR to have the two groups of units be treated as separate facilities covered by separate title V permits has been granted.

(5) Mr. Phil Glisson also indicated to me in a phone conversation the week of May 23rd that GA Power and Southern Power were concerned that the current administrative configuration of Wansley as a single facility might violate FERC regulations covering unfair business practices if GA Power or Southern Power solicited bids for electricity from electricity producers at large and GA Power submitted a bid to sell electricity to Southern or vice versa.

4/2/2012 - L DeSantis -  move of units 6A, 6B, 7A, 7B complete.
7/25/2011 - L DeSantis - Units 6A, 6B, 7A and 7B are being moved from Wansley (oris 6052) to Wansley CC (oris 55965).  Robert Miller of CAMD has confirmed that this is a separate facility from Wansley (oris 6052) for the following reasons:

(1) Each group of units are operated by different operators.  Units 1, 2, and 5A are operated by Georgia Power, units 6A, 6B, 7A, and 7B are operated by Southern Power.  Electricity produced by all of the units is dispatched by a 3rd party.

(2) None of the seven units listed above are jointly owned by Georgia Power and Southern Power.  Units 1, 2, and 5A are owned by Georgia Power and other non-Southern entities units 6A, 6B, 7A, and 7B are wholly owned by Southern Power.

(3) Although located on one piece of contiguous property, each group of units are physically separate, and do not share any common stacks or other emissions measuring or reporting equipment, save for the ECMPS client tool software currently used to collate and submit the emissions data recorded by each group's respective monitoring equipment under 40 CFR part 75.  In addition, each group of units has its own dedicated transmission line to transfer the power produced by the units to the grid.

(4)  According to Mr. Cornwell at GA DNR, the request from GA Power and Southern Power to GA DNR to have the two groups of units be treated as separate facilities covered by separate title V permits has been granted.

(5) Mr. Phil Glisson also indicated to me in a phone conversation the week of May 23rd that GA Power and Southern Power were concerned that the current administrative configuration of Wansley as a single facility might violate FERC regulations covering unfair business practices if GA Power or Southern Power solicited bids for electricity from electricity producers at large and GA Power submitted a bid to sell electricity to Southern or vice versa.
